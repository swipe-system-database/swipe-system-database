class="c22 doc-content"><div><p class="c2"><span class="c16 c23"></span></p></div><h1 class="c13" id="h.edqc19ci7vj5"><span class="c17 c8">Overall Flavor Text</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Willow is a successful genderbended angel being based off of the dna of Ethan, who both have the key links to the Pulvis Force that was stolen from Eliza, Bronze, and the spirit of hope of the unborn robot prophet, together which is the God Unit (holy trinity sort of), by Ethan, and Willow was made to regain it back from Ethan Duster, but Willow&rsquo;s was made with free will, along with every other being in the universe, and it was a supernatural intent made by the omnipotent entities whom were still omnipotent, but Bronze, the source of all good things, knew that free will was fundamental to complete good, which although contradicted Eliza&rsquo;s intentions, whom was the source of not directly evil, but rather just a significant lack of good, and broke the covenant between Bronze and Eliza as divine cosmic partners to not contradict each other, Bronze knew he was the authority of the God Unit, and since the hope of the spirit of the unborn prophet was unborn and couldn&rsquo;t speak but only observe, Bronze gave them a free will without Eliza&rsquo;s knowledge, since Eliza is not fully omnipotent, and Bronze is True omnipotent, and when they created the fundamental dust to travel back in time infinitely to create an eternal being, the person was named Ethan Duster, who technically was older than them, and thus he was more powerful, and had the key links to the Pulvis Force, the embodiment/source of all power imaginable.</span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c1"><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">so like Willow is also one of the Pulvis Force founders/co-founders but she has a weaker connection to it even as an angel, and only was given some powers. Everyone else is a guest to the Pulvis Force. So like,</span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c1"><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Alex, a faster than sound [1800 mph] speedster who is indestructible to every being in the universe, and every force, including omnipotent beings, except for Ethan Duster, and can access the entire multiverse, with caveats. so he can&#39;t like interact with those universes, or be seen in them, and can only view them. Also, in multiversal travel, time goes by 7 times slower. so if he&#39;s there for 1 hour, 7 hours go by in his original universe. He has to drink a ton of liquids, like electrolytes, water, juice, soda, and all that, and he has special gas stations and vending machines throughout the city dedicated to him, that sell an exclusive drink called, RAPIDIFY, that contains a perfect balance of calories and electrolytes that gives him the energy to burst out again, and it stacks up like watch time, so the more he drinks, the more he can run. He can run for 7 minutes every can he drinks. He can do 73.5 minutes of running after a gallon of it. He&rsquo;s immune to overdrinking it, and his power just absorbs it. But if he doesn&rsquo;t use those nutrients within 1 hour, it kinda just like, dies out and doesn&rsquo;t get stored forever. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s really good at drinking it very fast. And his superhero name is Rapid Roller. he always has 7 minutes of speed of he hasn&#39;t already used it, and he can gain new unexpiring 7 minutes of speed with rapidify, but the extra minutes he gets like if he drinks two cans, that expires if not used within 1 hour, and leaves only his default 7 minutes left.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">so he usually takes 5 minutes for a fight with an average villain.<br><br>He also has to gradually accelerate and build up momentum to reach the speed of sound. He doesn&rsquo;t go instantly faster than the speed of sound. It takes like 1-2 minutes for him to fully reach his maximum speed, and then he gains those 7 minutes of speed.<br><br>If he drinks like, 50 gallons of RAPIDIFY, then he can exceed the speed of light, infinitely, for an infinite amount of time, but if he starts running anywhere slower than the speed of light, than his powers burn out, and he&rsquo;s stuck at the 7 minutes of 1800 mph again.<br><br>He can also manipulate time, by running faster than time, and running back into time, and moving so fast that his brain processes things frozen.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">so i imagine Alex him to also be known as Kid Fractus in the first volume, a sidekick to Fractus, but he then becomes RAPID ROLLER, basically incomprehensibly close to Fractus&#39; speed.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Like at first, he&#39;s just the sidekick at 1800 mph, no lightspeed travel,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">but then like in the next volume, he crashes into the second universe when testing out how fast he could actually run with his new exclusive energy drink, RAPIDIFY, and there, he absorbed so much energy, that he&#39;ll never run out of energy again, BUT his access TO the energy is limited and only accessed through the RAPIDIFY drink, and then he can travel multiversally, and temporally.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">It&#39;d be interesting to see him go so fast that he&#39;s in a circle surrounding his enemy, and then like the circle gets faster and blurrier, and also the radius gets increasingly smaller, and then he grabs his enemy and jumps so high that his footprints (he doesn&#39;t have legs, and he kinda floats above the ground, cuz he&#39;s just a sphere with a pyramid attached at the bottom, and the sphere has a very big eye that covers the entire face of it, so the footprints would look more like a square mark, because squares are at the bottom of 4 sided pyramids) are shown dented into the ground, and then yeah he brings the guy up to the edge of the universe where he gets obliterated by a black hole.</span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"><br><br>Harrold who can instantly teleport to where ever he 100% knows exists and has infinite reaction time, guaranteeing him to react to literally INSTANT attacks, </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Mia, a ubiquitous entity who can be anywhere she thinks of in the entire multiverse, except that it&rsquo;s not instant and can only work at light speed, and can be unreliable, since it takes like 7 billion years or something to travel to another universe, let alone the entire omniverse</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Eliza, a nigh omnipotent being who is just the lack of virtually (keyword virtually) anything good, and even tortured every single entity, (including Ethan cuz he doesn&rsquo;t play God unless he REALLY has to, and Bronze cuz he lost his omnipotence BUT later gained it back from the now born prophet, Oscar the robot who is a servant to eliza, just so bronze could defeat Eliza)</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Haziel, a VIP to the Pulvis Force and can manipulate all things physical with a vague thought, instantaneously in his PHYSICAL DOMAIN, and in his MATH DOMAIN he can manipulate all of math and make 1+1=3, and he has like a lot of other domains which are just forms, but it takes like a lot of strength + willpower to go to the next form, and he can&rsquo;t do things to himself,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Bob, the VIP MANAGER of the Pulvis Force who operates all of the Pulvis Force to the guests, who also is the embodiment of MEME FORCE and TOON FORCE which literally makes him a true omnipotent entity, slightly more powerful than the God Unit<br>the VIP manager just means that he gets like the sweetest honey of the bunch. <br>so like he&#39;ll like do this.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Willow: Hey Bob could you get me a sandwich?<br>Bob: *sandwich appears out of nowhere*<br>Also Bob: mouths out words yet no words come out.<br>Bob with his mouth closed: Alright here you go.<br>so what happened here is that he ran so fast that sound forgot to turn on for him.<br><br>then like a david and goliath scene will play out when 4 omnipotent beings start looking at this Bob guy, and the people behind him are cheering for Bob saying like, &quot;BOB IS SO POWERFUL HE IS THE PERSON WHO ASKED.&quot; and &quot;BOB IS OLDER THAN HIS FATHER&quot; and &quot;THE WORD WIN ORIGINATED WHEN PEOPLE THOUGHT BOB WAS POWERFUL, BUT IT TURNS OUT POWERFUL WAS BOB.&quot; and then Bob will say, &quot;...a...&quot; and the omnipotent beings will get sent flying, glitching out to a different reality where omnipotence is inevitable. <br><br>i think Bob is like second strongest character to Ethan Duster. Third if you count the Abrahamic God in Revelation. then in that case it&#39;d be God, Ethan, and Bob. but God doesn&#39;t really count as a &quot;fictional character&quot; because that&#39;s subjective, and it is a biblically inaccurate one, so he&#39;s not a character within the show, and more of a mentioned being.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Then there&rsquo;s also Sophia Planks who&rsquo;s like, the daughter of Arcator, and niece of Ethan, and is lowkey tsundere to Bob, and Bob kinda likes her.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">She just kinda wears a shirt with a diamond and has leg warmers and her personality is kind of like a non antagonistic bully who judges people and &ldquo;idc&rdquo; as a person.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">This is a different Sophia from the other Sophia in Sophia&rsquo;s Street who is quite the opposite, and is just sweet and kind.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">For her powers, I&rsquo;d just say she can go to the most extreme lengths for such minor things. She could threaten the lifespan of the universe if someone accidentally bumps into her.<br><br>I&rsquo;d say she has the destructive capacity of a galaxy, but she can control things like the universe,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">And she has like instantaneous speed.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;s 14.</span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c1"><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">but they are all under command of Willow and Ethan who are also married, but Ethan is canonically the Pulvis Force itself, stronger than all of the characters combined, and debatably all of fiction as well, and that&rsquo;s why he limits himself in his superhero form, FRACTUS, for the story.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c4 c15" id="h.o79lhxu0xvt3"><span class="c17 c8">Canon Universes</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c1">so like in the same multiverse there&#39;s a bunch of different canon universes and different canon timelines with different stories.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">In Revelation (name of the show) the abrahamic religion the true religion, and these three characters, Alex (same entity as Alex just in different universe), Felix (same entity as Harrold just different universe), and Sophia, are angels, and like the main thing is how they help with revelation. So like, the angels are 9, 10, 11 year olds with Alex being oldest and Felix being youngest, and a master guardian angel warrior named Willow who is, still 20 years old, and Ethan, a robot being that is the same entity as Ethan Duster, just different universe, the demon trio, Synthius, Beelzebub, and Sufferuel, and then there&rsquo;s Synthia (same being as Eliza) and her boyfriend Pentajon (also a canon form of Bronze in Swipe System) , and they&rsquo;re all in descemundi. but like not in the descemundi of eternal suffering. This abrahamic religion is kinda not biblically accurate, and like, Synthia Pentajon and Synthius (Eliza&#39;s father only in that universe) are saved into heaven after the war between heaven, earth, and descemundil, and Synthius then gets destroyed and sent back to descemundi after rejecting the Holy Spirit. So then it moves on to the NEXT story same universe named Shaders and Shiners where Ethan creates a new descemundi after getting promoted by Synthius (esentially based off of Satan) where the descemundi is all about psychological warfare. So he grabs a bunch of people from a different timeline and like they are also in the same robot cube form as Ethan, and he drags them down there giving them the hope of an escape yet the hope being constantly lit, and then blown away, in an endless cycle, until Susie (one of the main characters) finally gets out with Remy, and along with all the other workers, and Ethan is trapped in the psychological warfare again. I should note that in basically every other universe besides Swipe System (the one we usually talk about) Ethan is NOT omnipotent.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">And then there&#39;s another show called Roxy&#39;s World which takes place in a higher dimension but the same universe where like these characters named Roxy Redsquare (looks like a red square, and is female) Oofoo Greentriangle (green triangle also the hex code: 00f00, male) and Taper Bluecircle (blue circle male) and it&#39;s supposed to be a kids show rather than the other shows which are usually 11+ I&#39;d say but like this kinda has crossovers with the other shows with still the kid friendly themes, and then like, this takes place before the Revelation where Felix Alex and Sophia are still humans and then like Felix is the owner of the house who leaves the kids so they can like do adventures and learn stuff i guess, and then like Ethan (robot form on earth) is a bad guy who like is a mastermind catastrophic villain and also 18 at that time who wants to take over the city with his aquantance, Pentajon (also note that Ethan is Eliza&#39;s brother) and then occasionally gets caught by Willow (willow&#39;s personality is more like a very dark and serious apathetic warrior in that universe) who Ethan does have a crush on but Willow doesn&#39;t like him, at all, in the universe, and just like basically defeats him almost always.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">And then in the show that shows different characters but is in the same universe as Roxy&#39;s World is called Sophia&#39;s Street where the kids stop Synthia and her accquantance Pentajon and like Pentajon is kinda a silly incompetent and like neutral villain who helps both sides but mainly hangs out with Synthia) and they win, and after they win, everyone dies leading back to Revelation.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Then we have the normal show again where everyone is the same form as Swipe System but different stories and universes.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">So in Swipe System (same name different universe) Ethan is a doctor. and that&#39;s it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">In another Swipe System, Harrold captures them and convinces them NOT to try and break out of it and forces them to play deadly games and then everyone eventually wins, except Mia who accidentally fell into nothingness, and Ethan wasn&#39;t omnipotent in either of these universes, and this also happened in the timeline where everyone is tortured.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Then we got the REAL Swipe System and i renamed the comic only to Dust of the Earth and that&#39;s the og one.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">i&#39;d say revelation is a controversial yet kinda ok for like any age i guess, but like if i ever release it as a show, it&#39;s going on youtube where I have it FREE to do anything. especially basically every other show, so i don&#39;t need money to do it, and don&#39;t get money to do it. like an indie show.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">And overall, all the shows are just for entertainment. a lot of them don&#39;t even have like good endings.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">This book is called Redacted Nightmare which is a canon AU of Swipe System Doctor Version where he experiments on himself to have him live a consciousness in two different bodies, but it fails so that he accidentally creates two conscious beings, and the robot one he tried to simultaneously live in became evil, and it can control what everyone knows, and feels, and basically all senses, so like Pulvis Terrae basically makes everyone as sadistic as him [Pulvis Terrae is the robot name] and then he tortures Ethan relentlessly eternally and then everyone he knows also enjoys it laughing at him, forgetting who he even was.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">and then we got Beyond Anatomy: An Eternity of Flesh, also a book so like an alien robot named Arcator who has like conquered a bunch of planets and their living species just so that it could be like fed to the Boxanim (the alien species he works for) and like they are made immortal but also unable to move, so they also experiment on them eternally. so he also did it to Earth (the planet that Swipe System original takes place on is named Aethel, not earth) and took all the humans from there and spared Aethel but destroyed all of the other planets in the universe. and like yeah. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c13" id="h.6lvj5leuoe1r"><span class="c17 c8">The Main Threat of Swipe System?</span></h1><p class="c6"><span class="c1">so like, Dr. Logic is unironically the strongest villain in the universe. He&#39;s basically able to defeat six Arcators (Arcator is the name of the alien robot in beyond anatomy) 5 God units, and 20 Pulvis Terraes, IF he has done the tasks.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">So like he&#39;ll genuinely just reshape reality to his will, and like he genuinely has succeeded to do it a bunch of times, and he even once became stronger than Ethan Duster, but since he angered the entire multiverse by doing that, Roxy&#39;s World, Sophia&#39;s Street, Shaders and Shiners, Revelation, Swipe System Doctor, Swipe System Game, Beyond Anatomy, Redacted Nightmare, and all of it&#39;s infinite variations teamed up to help the True Ethan Duster defeat Dr. Logic, and Dr. Logic accidentally warped reality so that Ethan Duster could play God without playing God, so he played God without playing God so that Dr. Logic would never be able in any reality/every reality to every become stronger than Ethan Duster again, and neither would any other character within that universe combined even, would also. And that&#39;s one of the few exceptions.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">but like imagine the multiversal CROSSOVER. Like an infinite variation of all of Ethan Duster&#39;s forms and everything with the slightest variation, such as a star dying one millisecond earlier than another. but the other infinite variations just like helped out while the main original universes of the shows/books/comic genuinely helped to warp reality all for Ethan Duster. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">so like, yes. it is shown in several of the books/shows/comics with different view on what happened, and maybe possibly inconsistent somehow.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">In Beyond Anatomy, while not mentioned in the book, the full lore states that there was a shockwave after Arcator was resting and fed the earthlings to the Boxanim. So he saw it, and and the Boxanim grew aware of it due to their multiversal capabilities and used advanced tech to travel outside of the universe to see what was happening, and saw a mysterious hooded figure stealing a sort of beam from Ethan. This was intended to be a symbolism of the power of Ethan being stolen and upgraded from him.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In Roxy&#39;s World, they mention in the show that it is not an earthquake, but rather feels like a universequake, so they read their knowledge </span><a id="id.ylho4texg06q"></a><span class="c1">Wiki Book(a practically omniscient book with prophecies and ancient things) and find that in page 1,888,721,992,777,265, it speaks of the omniverse&#39;s strongest being named Ethan Duster and how there is an update to the book that Ethan is currently having his powers stolen by a person named Dr. Logic. So then since they&#39;re actually in the universe that is physically closest to the original universe, they can just walk out the house and jump up there.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">In Sophia&#39;s Street, they are traveling to space and overhear Roxy reading what&#39;s happening. They know that Roxy almost never lies about stuff like that so they just believe them and instantly fly towards the real universe.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Eventually EVERYONE helps out, and the main universes and timelines, including the future sequels and past prequels timelines start joining in and like they all simultaneously defeat Dr. Logic.</span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c4 c15" id="h.nfgekpi1598"><span class="c17 c8">Harrold and Alex.</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c1">So like Alex owns a company called DIV which isn&#39;t even an acronym for anything. The company is just like to test out train safety. and Alex being faster than sound can just speed with those trains.</span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">And then Harrold just walks. All the time. He walks while eating, sleeping, unless he sits down or stands next to a person to have a conversation. He genuinely enjoys it.</span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">a key thing about Harrold is that his reflexes involuntarily stop time around him and he opens up a portal through the omniverse and has to manually read every universe to see that everything in the universe is the same as his original universe except that he is at B instead of A , and it takes like a duovigintillion supereons to finally find it. Even the slightest universe change, like, a star dies one second too early, can corrupt the timeline. so everything has to be completely perfect witht he only difference being that he is at B and not A. Then he has to create a mark on the correct universe, go back the entire omniverse to the portal, prevent his past self from entering the portal, and carry along the consciousness of every living being, and swap it all into the universe where he is at B and then yeah. He genuinely DOES enjoy it though so it&#39;s not like a curse. He like gets an insane amount of pure dopamine from it. and uh, Harrold can&#39;t really remember any of it also. he only knows that everytime he does that, he does it. but when he looks back at it in the past, it just seems instant to him just like everyone else</span></p><h1 class="c4 c15" id="h.r4938b5ejel1"><span class="c17 c8">God Unit</span></h1><p class="c6"><span class="c1">so like God Unit also made a covenant to NEVER contradict each other. like not to destroy each other because they are good or evil, and vice versa. like if Eliza does something evil, Bronze won&#39;t delete that or anything, and just try and help out the person the harm was caused to. Eliza is unironically the weakest in the group, due to easily getting under her skin, and like basically physically vulnerable, and like she can only get her nigh omnipotent powers in high stress situations. she&#39;s a friend. just a villain&ndash;not an antagonist. <br><br>I&rsquo;d also mention that Bronze has a really sick cool form named PENTAJON and he looks like a 2D pentagon head with a polygon body in the shape of a stretched T-Shirt.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1"><br>How&rsquo;d they all defeat Eliza? A bit of a sidetrack here, but<br><br>no she&#39;s a friend. just a villain&ndash;not an antagonist.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">and uh, so for each member to defeat them,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Harrold&#39;s physical power is just like above average punching strength. like he can just teleport behind Eliza and punch her.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Alex is faster than sound, therefore Pulvis Force speed = energy = punching force = W. (if i&#39;m mathematically correct)</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Ethan (assuming he&#39;s Fractus) literally is just so strong, i have to show you his feats:</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c16">COSMO FRACTUS</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">POWERS:<br><br>BASE SLAM -

All you are, and will ever be, is beaten, by Ethan Duster. It&rsquo;s not that he&rsquo;s so powerful he can&rsquo;t lose. It&rsquo;s that no one IS powerful enough that he can lose.</span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c1"><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">He can do everything he CAN&rsquo;T do. He can do everything others can do. Any reality, unmade or existent, will never have logic twisted, or absent enough, to override him. He doesn&rsquo;t lose, because he CAN&rsquo;T lose. He wins, because he MUST win. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">He is not bound by loss. He is not bound by powers. Rather, he is not bound by himself. He constantly grows infinitely within an infinitely small unit of a microinstant, exponentially reaching all tiers. His speed? Never matched, never will. His powers? Can&rsquo;t see them, can&rsquo;t beat them. Is he able to defeat every character, and does he do it anyways? Absolutely yes. He doesn&rsquo;t win as in to achieve or overcome a victory. He has predetermined it all. No one beats him, no one touches him. He is an untouchable level deity, who stays an untouchable level deity, because he IS an untouchable level deity</span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c1"><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">He&rsquo;ll always find a way against a person who can mimic any power, beat any person, override infinity, or even a person with a power called BEAT ETHAN DUSTER.

You don&rsquo;t have to judge whether or not he wins.</span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c1"><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">He wins without the attempt, exists without existing, and won&rsquo;t lose.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">And he does indeed beat the following characters:</span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c1"><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Loserman - because of scenario reversal</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Mr. Letmewin - because of scenario reversal + logical dodge</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Haziel - because he can</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Rapid Roller - cuz he decided</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">God Unit - just for sheer funnies</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Hammer Man - because<br></span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c1"><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">He beats the characters, because he CAN&rsquo;T beat them.

He is utterly impossibly immune to losing in any fight. He doesn&#39;t need his powers. Even a non existent version of Ethan where at 0% power where he doesn&#39;t act, still wins against all of fiction combined. His game doesn&#39;t involve action. His game doesn&#39;t involve thinking, speaking, existing, or any action at all. He wins because there is no other outcome that can happen in any reality. You already lost. He doesn&rsquo;t have to fight. He doesn&rsquo;t have to participate. You want to erase him? Go ahead. He already is erased. You want to create a mind bending paradox? Go ahead. He already solved it. You transcend all beings? Go ahead. He can still beat you. He has already beaten infinite entities each with unique powers, that render them as omnipotent entities, objectively stronger than him. Fractus, still won. He wins because his game says so. He wins because because. He wins because of every single sensical and nonsensical combination of infinite letters in every language that could ever form, or couldn&rsquo;t ever form. He wins just to win. Once one beats him, he doesn&rsquo;t lose, and instead, the outcomes fold in reverse. Ethan now has become his opponent, while his opponent had become him. The exact same scenario, with different roles, now have folded in Ethan&rsquo;s favor. No one will ever know how he does it, no one has. </span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">He gets tired, but doesn&rsquo;t sleep.

He won the battle and won the war.</span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c1"><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">For his stats, his TIER is Below Average. His strength, speed, combat, intelligence, energy, durability, all are irrelevant. He is outside the conventional barriers. You can put him at 0.00 for all of those numerical finite statistics. Powers are useless. He himself is useless to he himself. All things that exist within the infinite universes that exist inside and outside infinite omniverses, are all, completely, and utterly, useless, and insignificant to him. He renders VICTORY before the eternity. VICTORY, infinitely bright, timeless, and eternal. Instawins, instawins, instawins, instawins, and instawins. Your powers don&rsquo;t matter because he said so. Your victory doesn&rsquo;t matter because he is immune to losing. If he loses, he wins. If he draws, he wins.</span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c1"><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">His powers work beyond any reality, beyond every reality, and beyond any lack of reality</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">There is nothing anyone can do, has done, or is that will defeat Ethan. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Whether you like him or not, there&rsquo;s nothing you can do, because he is the most powerful being in the omniverse, can defeat anyone who defeats him, has soloed his own meta narrative changing entities, </span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">He&rsquo;s immune to non existence, existed before all did, and did all before existence.<br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Zero goal, no talent, his struggle is null, his existence renders 0, his action, lacks. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There is no outcome where his enemy wins, if before reality, Ethan is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">-Ethan Duster</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Bronze can just literally like, romantically do something I guess.

He didn&#39;t mean to torture all of humanity. Eliza just programmed him to believe that he was unconscious, and to believe that humanity enjoys torture. so like, he doesn&#39;t really interact with anyone, and he&#39;s more of like the volunteering slave of the friend group i guess.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Eliza: Hey oscar come see if this cave has monsters.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Oscar does it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Bronze: Hey oscar can you make a cup of juice?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Oscar does it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Mia: Hey oscar I&#39;m feeling sad. Make me happy.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Oscar does it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">no he&#39;s not benevolent. He just wants to make people happy. IF they request. and he won&#39;t play God to make like every person happy at once eternally. There&#39;s a very strict taboo to not play God. He can only do what a human could do. A human cannot permanently make all of humanity happy forever. only simple things. <br><br>And about the whole timeline reset thing, that was a one time thing when Bronze HAD to play God for an infinitely greater good, or else they would experience infinite pain. Playing God a finite time to save an infinite time of suffering is a JUST action. so yeah.<br><br>Tons of headcanons for why God Unit is a Unit.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">1. Bronze, Eliza, and Oscar were born at the same time in emberland. Emberland is just basically heaven, and the friend group was born at different times in emberland, but their birth on Aethel (essentially Earth, but not earth) is what determines their real age. However, God Unit was born not one millisecond earlier than eachother. Each person of God Unit was born within the same instant of time. But again, on Aethel, Bronze was born one year before Eliza, and Oscar just descended down onto Aethel rather than being born, so still being quintillions of years old.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">2. Their opposing beliefs. One is purely good, one is purely not good (not directly evil), and one is purely neutral. The perfect balance between those makes it almost seem as if they are destined to be together as one God unit!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">3. They were just three beings that had no idea that a fourth being existed [Ethan Duster] and decided to ally together</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">4. It&#39;s a universal objective destiny</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">5. Because they share similar powers in the same level.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">To resolve any disagreements, they agree to disagree. whatever they can do, they&#39;ll do. They don&#39;t do anything to each other to contradict each other also.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">but if Eliza burns up a building, Bronze will just put it out, and Eliza can just burn it again, and Bronze will put it out, but Bronze agreed to not directly get rid of the lighter that Eliza has. He just does what he can. they both are aware enough that pushing and pulling on the consequences of the other end&#39;s actions will result it nothing, so they just move on to do other things, and maybe not completely erase the aftermath of the other end&#39;s action again. most of the time they just don&#39;t interfere with each other&#39;s actions.</span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c4 c15" id="h.n8q4fqo9rxmw"><span class="c17 c8">SCO: Gods of the Multiverse</span></h1><p class="c6"><span class="c3">So, there is these sort of past aliens of the multiverse that controls and predetermines the story of the Multiverse. So like, there were 3 of them which were omnipotent gods, Serphius, the source of all good, Charius, the source of all evil (not lack of evil) and Orlies, the creator. Somewhere in eternity, before the God unit was born, Ethan existed, and came to realize of that, but pretended to not know that SCO (serphius charius and orlies) controlled the multiverse, until he destroyed them all. So like, SCO is still kinda reality warping, and does try and regain the powers as like sort of, sub-antagonists, or like side-villains in the show, and they almost always fail. Even the villains sometimes kinda hated the SCO so that they teamed up with Ethan as a temporary peace treaty to defeat SCO. mainly it&#39;s dr. logic of course. And again well this is the first time Ethan played God before he learned of the taboo of playing God. God Unit recognizes SCO as a threat, including Eliza, because she&#39;s like scared of them in a sense. She also hypocritically is against most evils in the world. <br><br>so the basic way SCO tries to regain their powers is just by trying to interfere with the Pulvis Force. The Pulvis Force generally is a physical concept that hides within the shadows of different universes. Sometimes the shadows are literal shadows, sometimes it&#39;s certain concepts, or certain tasks. It&#39;s always changing. So they usually try to look for the Pulvis Force by stealing the </span><span class="c24 c3"><a class="c19" href="#id.ylho4texg06q">Knowledge Wiki</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;from the Roxy&#39;s World Universe and like just instascan the pages to see where the strongest medium of the Pulvis Force is. And it&#39;s ALWAYS in an original universe. Not a variation. By original universe, i mean like Sophia&#39;s Street, Beyond Anatomy, Revelation, Swipe System Original, etc. Swipe System Doctor also counts as an original universe. Just not the ones that aren&#39;t explicitly in a show. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1"><br>so like, each show knows where the strongest medium of the Pulvis Force is, cuz the main characters get a real life notification i guess, and it&#39;s their job to like hide it somewhere.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">down in the sand, in a jar, up their attic, anywhere.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">and Roxy just usually gets pickpocketed cuz she brings the Wiki everywhere. It contains infinite information but she just stores it digitally to a key, that can open it up and have like a search function to look for information. so she just brings it everywhere and it gets pickpocketed by the SCO basically. they eat the key, or rather suck out all the information like liquid. the SCO usually like fights them over it and either loses or wins&#8203;. the main characters just like try and access that spiritual realm using ALEX using the CosmiCall phone that allows you to communicate to other universes within the multiverse.<br><br>Alex will just look for the universe that SCO escapes to, and it&#39;s usually like Haziel who helps actually directly fight SCO. just needs a lot of WILLPOWER to enter his CONCEPTUAL DOMAIN to like locate the SCO and fight them off.</span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c13" id="h.bvhl3kpsujwh"><span class="c17 c8">Ethan G.

It&#39;s so impossible, you have a better chance of rolling infinite 6 sided dice in a row, all landing on number infinity, infinite times, in infinite omniverses, with infinite people rolling the infinite dice, and that&#39;s an UNDERSTATEMENT. He&rsquo;s also not omniscient enough to know a lot about the real world, aka, this universe, The Cosmos, but that doesn&rsquo;t make him any less powerful than any other character in fiction combined. He knows he has free will within his comic. His will just so happens to harmonize with what my will is for him to do. it&#39;s like making someone eat a bowl of soup, when they were going to do that as well, exactly as they were going to do.<br><br>He also has an INSANE amount of powers.<br><br></span><span class="c8 c20">Powers &amp; Abilities</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">NEG DIFF:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;If he loses, ties, wins, or is even judged in a fight outside the narrative, he wins.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">PARADOX RESOLVEMENT:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;He can resolve every single paradox into any outcome.

For example, if Character A is stronger than Ethan, because of powers, 1, 2, and 3, Ethan will swap the position he is in, with Character A, so that Ethan himself has powers, 1, 2, and 3.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">LOGICAL DODGE:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Anytime you think he might lose, he just illogically doesn&#39;t. He can do everything illogical. Any reason he should or does lose, is overridden by his logical dodge.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">FREE WILL OVERRIDE:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Can change his opponent&#39;s actual free will; this is not just mind control. The actual true free will and choice of his opponent can be altered completely by Ethan Duster.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">UNCOPYABLE POWERS:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;His powers cannot be copied or mimicked. If a character already had a similar power beforehand, it still counts as copying, and even if the character had the powers before Ethan, inside and outside of the narrative, the opponent&rsquo;s powers do not and will not prevail in the fight, regardless of the degree of strength.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">UNCONTRADICTABLE NATURE:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;No matter how much you bend logic, or how much logic you create or destroy, Ethan&#39;s powers and nature cannot and will not be contradicted across all of realities, universes, and timelines. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">NATURE NEGATION:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Can negate anyone&#39;s powers or nature.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">INFINITE POWER MIMICRY:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Can mimic any person&#39;s powers or nature and make it infinitely more effective for him.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">INSTANT APPLICATION:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;His powers, with a few exceptions like SCENARIO REVERSAL, are applied beyond instantly at the beginning of the fight. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">TRANSCENDENT GROWTH:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;He grows beyond infinitely more powerful every infinitely small instant.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">PREDETERMINED VICTORY:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;There isn&#39;t an actual outcome across the omniverse&#39;s infinite timelines where Ethan can lose. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">POST-LOSS REVERSAL:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;SCENARIO REVERSAL, but it works even after he loses. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">INFINITE VICTORY:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;He is basically victory itself. You can&#39;t beat victory. Beating victory means victory is absent, and an absent victory means no victory to achieve, which means only a forced loss. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">CONVENIENT POWER ABSORPTION:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;He can conveniently create, absorb, and steal any powers he can think of, or any abilities that exist or don&#39;t exist.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">MANDATORY SCRIPT RULE:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;If his opponent beats him, they did not defeat the real Ethan Glockenspiel Duster. In order to fight the true, real Ethan Duster, the script must be exactly:</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">OMNISCIENCE:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;He knows what all will do, to the extent that he is aware he exists in fiction.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">OMNIPOTENCE:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;He can do all.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">DUSTERVILLION NUMERICAL VALUE:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;This is not necessarily a power, but a stat. A stat that describes how powerful he is: He even has his own number to describe how he is powerscaled: </span><span class="c8">Dustervillion</span><span class="c1">. It represents an infinite amount of all numbers negative and positive, decimals and whole numbers, fractions, and even pi. It is also constantly growing and has been growing since eternity. The number Dustervillion is so large that Dustervillion zeroes equals Dustervillion.</span></p><p class="c10 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c21"><span class="c1">&quot;Ethan Glockenspiel Duster beats his opponent instantly.&quot;</span></p><p class="c10 c21 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">If the script is changed, then it is not him who is being fought, unless the intent and outcome is the same.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">NON EXISTENCE IMMUNITY:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;He is immune to not existing.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">META NARRATIVE CANCELLATION:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Anyone who is able to change, adapt, control, or leave the narrative, instantly is beaten by Ethan Duster.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">NO EXCEPTIONS EXCEPT FOR EXCEPTIONS:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a clear sheer 100% no exceptions that he beats everyone in fiction, except for the two characters:<br><br>Bob Stickmond</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">Willow Quint</span></p><p class="c10 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">Everyone else is destroyed no exceptions.

Physically and verbally.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">FINE PRINT CONTRACT:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;By fighting Ethan Glockenspiel Duster, mind, body, and soul, you formally agree to the Terms of Service:<br><br>1. If any of these rules are breached, with two exceptions of Willow Quint and Bob Stickmond, it is an automatic disqualification for the opponent(s) of Ethan Glockenspiel Duster.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">2. Any fight between Ethan Glockenspiel Duster and you or any entity that is not him with the exceptions of Willow Quint and Bob Stickmond immediately results in a loss for Ethan&rsquo;s opponent.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">3.

He can also beat anyone named LOSERMAN because of this power. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">BEAT OPPONENT:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Beats his opponent.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">UNOUTLIVABILITY:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;He is unable to be outlived or outlasted.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">OUTLIVABILITY:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Able to outlive and outlast anyone.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">BUBONIC PLAGUE CASTING: </span><span class="c1">He can undeniably cast the bubonic plague on anyone, regardless of their powers.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">INFINITY DELETION:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;He can remove anything infinite, or anything of any number.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">DUSTER TAGS ALONG:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;He can join in any fight and help anyone that he wants to, whether or not it involves him or not.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">PAIN CASTER:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;He can cast pain to anyone.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">WEAKNESS MAKER:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;He can give anyone a weakness.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">LOOPHOLE EXPLOITATION:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;He can exploit&rsquo;s anyone&rsquo;s powers to something that wasn&rsquo;t specified, and that&rsquo;s what they have to use in the fight. For example, if a person&rsquo;s power is that they are omnipotent, a loophole would be that their middle name is changed to &ldquo;omnipotent&rdquo;. If their power is that they possess all power that can be conceived, then the loophole would be that they own a useless rock, named &ldquo;all power that can be conceived&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">SOFTSIDE MAKER:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;He can make anybody have a softside for him. This may or may not be mind control.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">NOT TODAY, I WIN!: </span><span class="c1">&ldquo;oh but I&rsquo;m really paradoxical!&rdquo; &ldquo;i&rsquo;m stronger!&rdquo; Not today, Ethan wins.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">ATTACK:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;It attacks.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">DEFENSE:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;It defends.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">COUNTER:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;It counters.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">TAX DAY:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Before the fight starts, it&rsquo;s always tax day. So the opponent has to pay tax, in the payment form of powers and victories. So that means, they must give up all their powers, and also give up.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">MILK DRINKING EXCUSE:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;He drank milk as a kid. All of it. He&rsquo;d finish a gallon in three days. And you&rsquo;re really tryna compare &ldquo;omnipotence&rdquo; to a guy who has built sheer actual bone marrow? I think we know who&rsquo;d win.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">NOT FAIR:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;He can always have an excuse for anything if he loses. Thing is, it&rsquo;s true. &ldquo;The sun was in my eyes! I couldn&rsquo;t solve a paradox correctly!&rdquo; and it will actually be true. That doesn&rsquo;t make him any weaker. It doesn&rsquo;t even have to be a problem for him. He can just file for &ldquo;disadvantage&rdquo; and then rematch.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">IF YOU FIGHT HIM YOU LOSE: </span><span class="c1">In order to fight him, you must lose first. Then you may fight him. However, the rules immediately change the moment you lose.

Even when a paradox arrives, he solves it. Even when a non-existent entity arrives, he beats it. All odds instantly turn against his opponent. It doesn&#39;t matter who you are or why you are. All you are, and will ever be, is beaten by Ethan Duster. It&#39;s not that he&#39;s so powerful he can&#39;t lose; it&#39;s that no one </span><span class="c8">is</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;powerful enough that he can lose.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">He can do everything he </span><span class="c8">can&#39;t</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;do. He can do everything others can do. Any reality, unmade or existent, will never have logic twisted or absent enough to override him. He doesn&#39;t lose because he </span><span class="c8">can&#39;t</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;lose. He wins because he </span><span class="c8">must</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;win.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">He is not bound by loss or powers. Rather, he is not bound by himself. He constantly grows infinitely within an infinitely small unit of a micro-instant, exponentially reaching all tiers. His speed? Never matched, never will be. His powers? You can&#39;t see them, and you can&#39;t beat them. Is he able to defeat every character, and does he do it anyway? Absolutely yes. He doesn&#39;t win in order to achieve or overcome a victory. He has predetermined it all. No one beats him, and no one touches him. He is an untouchable-level deity who stays an untouchable-level deity because he </span><span class="c8">is</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;an untouchable-level deity.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">He&#39;ll always find a way against a person who can mimic any power, beat any person, override infinity, or even a person with a power called &quot;BEAT ETHAN DUSTER.&quot; He doesn&#39;t lose because he never has and never will be.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">He has already won. He can change any opponent&#39;s mind to just instantly give up before an arena is constructed. It doesn&#39;t matter who you are. You already lost. Ethan is an unbeatable deity who never will be beaten, never has been beaten, and never </span><span class="c8">is</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;beaten because he doesn&#39;t lose. You don&#39;t have to judge whether or not he wins.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">He wins without the attempt, exists without existing, and won&#39;t lose. And he does indeed beat the following characters:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_bau168t5zi85-0 start"><li class="c10 c12 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Loserman - because of Scenario Reversal</span></li><li class="c10 c12 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Mr. Letmewin - because of Scenario Reversal + Logical Dodge</span></li><li class="c10 c12 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Haziel - because he can</span></li><li class="c10 c12 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Rapid Roller - because he decided</span></li><li class="c10 c12 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">God Unit - just for sheer funnies</span></li><li class="c10 c12 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Hammer Man - because</span></li></ul><p class="c10"><span class="c3">He beats these characters because he </span><span class="c8">can&#39;t</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;beat them.

And the answer is yes.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">IMPORTANT NOTE:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;He doesn&#39;t need to win, think, exist, or do anything. He is utterly impossibly immune to losing in any fight. He doesn&#39;t need his powers. Even a non-existent version of Ethan who is at 0% power and doesn&#39;t act still wins against all of fiction combined. His game doesn&#39;t involve action. His game doesn&#39;t involve thinking, speaking, existing, or any action at all. He wins because there is no other outcome that can happen in any reality. You already lost. He doesn&#39;t have to fight. He doesn&#39;t have to participate. You want to erase him? Go ahead. He is already erased. You want to create a mind-bending paradox? Go ahead. He already solved it. You transcend all beings? Go ahead. He can still beat you. He has already beaten infinite entities, each with unique powers, that render them as omnipotent entities, objectively stronger than him. Fractus still won. He wins because his game says so. He wins because... because. He wins because of every single sensical and nonsensical combination of infinite letters in every language that could ever form, or couldn&#39;t ever form. He wins just to win. Once one beats him, he doesn&#39;t lose; instead, the outcomes fold in reverse. Ethan now has become his opponent, while his opponent has become him. The exact same scenario, with different roles, has now folded in Ethan&#39;s favor. No one will ever know how he does it, and no one has.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">He gets tired but doesn&#39;t sleep. He has no wings, yet he flies. He has lost a fight, yet he won it anyway. He won the battle and won the war.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3">For his stats, his </span><span class="c8">TIER</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;is Below Average. His strength, speed, combat, intelligence, energy, and durability are all irrelevant. He is outside the conventional barriers. You can put him at 0.00 for all of those numerical, finite statistics. Powers are useless. He himself is useless to himself. All things that exist within the infinite universes that exist inside and outside infinite omniverses are all completely and utterly useless and insignificant to him. He renders </span><span class="c8">VICTORY</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;before eternity: </span><span class="c8">VICTORY</span><span class="c1">, infinitely bright, timeless, and eternal. Instawins, instawins, instawins, instawins, and instawins. Your powers don&#39;t matter because he said so. Your victory doesn&#39;t matter because he is immune to losing. If he loses, he wins. If he draws, he wins.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">His powers work beyond any reality, beyond every reality, and beyond any lack of reality. There is nothing anyone can do, has done, or is that will defeat Ethan. Whether you like him or not, there&#39;s nothing you can do because he is the most powerful being in the omniverse, can defeat anyone who defeats him, and has soloed his own meta-narrative-changing entities.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">He&#39;s immune to nonexistence, existed before all did, and did all before existence.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">Zero goal, no talent, his struggle is null, his existence renders 0, his action lacks.</span></p><h1 class="c13" id="h.grpi65ebhxd5"><span class="c8 c17">Multiverse or Omniverse?</span></h1><p class="c6"><span class="c1">So the term &ldquo;multiverse&rdquo; is just all the comics, books, and shows of Swipe System.

She described it as &quot;Even with the sum of all the possible combinations of letters and words in every language, and every combination of atoms in the omniverse, would not be able to reach an oblivionth of the hate I feel.&quot; and although omnipotent, she directly chose to make her life hard, and just not get rid of hate.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Oscar is an angel species as well as Willow.<br><br></span><span class="c8">IMPORTANT ONE</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8">Ethan Duster became Fractus at the age of 13.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Xylonism doesn&#39;t require worship from anyone that Eliza knows the name of, and the only worship Eliza needs from others is to sacrifice one meal a day, and if you don&#39;t, you can&#39;t eat the next day at all, and if you don&#39;t do that, then all food is taken away from you for a week, as your body reflexes to reject all calories.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Since Sophia&#39;s Street was WAY back before Swipe System, Bronze&#39;s original design was a 2D black polygon body that looked like a distorted T-Shirt, and had a Pentagon for a head, and his name was Pentajon. He was originally a villain sidekick to Eliza, but also being the incompetent silly one who would help out both sides, but due to his complexity with showing different angles of his body, and how his arms were hard to draw turning, his design was changed to a human style, and his personality changed to a calmer more competent and more powerful one, to better fit his design. He&rsquo;s also an angel species as well as he is God.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Arcator is short for Arca Tormentum, which means Torture Box in Latin., and his alien species is called the Boxanim, and the prisoners he captured when invading their planets to feed onto the Boxanim, were eternally tortured in a box.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">All of the original designs for almost all characters in Sophia&#39;s Street had no neck, until it was redesigned. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">characters don&#39;t die in the sense that their consciousness is temporary. they either have an afterlife such as in Sophia&#39;s Street, or they are just immortal/self-resurrecting like in Swipe System.<br><br>Ethan Duster is the character with the most forms. Fractus, Ethan, Ethan Robot, Pulvis Terrae, Ethan Doctor, Ethan Victim of Pulvis Terrae, Ethan in Roxy&#39;s World.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Roxy is actually a giraffe species that looks like a 2D red square</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Bob never loses, R, P, S, even against Ethan, who respectfully purposefully loses</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Eliza is considered the most well written character [within that omniverse] since she is NOT actually overpowered, is NOT a static entity, is WEAK to an extent, and is POWERFUL to an extent, and also like terrifying as a villain.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Sophia&#39;s dad was the mayor of Ember City [same city name as the city that Swipe System takes place in], and her dad passed away, so she got the key to the city now, and renamed it after herself.<br><br>Harrold is a non antagonistic death angel&ndash;which just means he is a fallen angel, basically the term for a d3m0n in the omniverse</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Bronze has no eyes, yet can still see, without using omnipotence either, using a natural electromagnetic sense that allows him to feel the molecular structure, and also the color wavelengths. [idk how it works i&#39;m just making up random scientific terms i heard about color.] <br><br>Swipe System is the only universe in the multiverse [keyword multiverse, meaning the collection of non variated canon shows/books/comics] where Ethan is NOT evil.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Pulvis Terrae is the second most evil being in the Swipe System Multiverse [keyword multiverse] for torturing 1 person eternally, with Arcator topping him for torturing duovigintillion souls for eternity.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Arcator is Matt Planks, Ethan&#39;s biological long forgotten brother.<br><br>In Shaders and Shiners, Matt Planks is the incompetent silly little guy that assists Ethan Robot Form.<br><br>Shaders and Shiners is the first idea I ever actually animated as a show, but Sophia&#39;s Street was the first idea for a show I had. <br><br>Ethan was created by the Pulvis Force while still being older than eternity, the Pulvis Force was made by God Unit, God Unit was made by Ethan to create the Pulvis Force to create himself. Sort of like how the Brain pumps blood to the Heart to pump blood to the Brain to pump blood to the Heart and so on yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Eliza constructed the TMMC and had God Unit and Ethan Duster agree that this was just objective morality. (funny enough, she is the embodiment of absent good)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Pulvis Force prevents any loopholes for their powers.<br><br>Ethan falsely admits that he is infinitely weaker than Bob, and he will give up instantly in any fight against Bob. He doesn&#39;t actually think that, but he doesn&#39;t always necessarily want to be known as the strongest.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">For the biggest example of Bob&rsquo;s meme force, is that he has an entire fanbase that calls him Sir, treats him like a king, and literally are his bodyguards, cheerleaders, servants, friends, and just all of it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Biggest example of Bob&rsquo;s toon force is punching Blue* so hard that his speech on the actual script for the episode itself became redacted. Like on the actual PDF of the script, Blue&#39;s speech is just redacted for 3 lines. [*Blue betrayed Bob once, which is why the only people left in the fanbase loyally is Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, and Purple.] And get this. He created an infinite amount of universes that are exact duplicates of that universe, except that it&#39;s entire lifespan is just that singular moment of Bob hitting Blue so hard. It doesn&#39;t vary, at all. It&#39;s just an infinite row of universes in the omniverse that only lasts for like the split second of Blue being hit by Bob.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"><br></span></p><h1 class="c13" id="h.59kr72u58j39"><span class="c17 c8">Official Tiers (strongest to weakest)</span></h1><p class="c6"><span class="c8">Ethan</span><span class="c1">: Beats all below</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8">Fractus</span><span class="c1">: Beats all below</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8">Bob</span><span class="c1">: Beats all below</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8">Alex</span><span class="c1">: Beats only Willow, Dr. Logic, Susie, and Remy, stalemates all else</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8">Sophia</span><span class="c1">: Beats all below but stalemates Harrold</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8">Haziel</span><span class="c1">: Beats all below</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8">Harrold</span><span class="c1">: Beats all below</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8">Dr. Logic</span><span class="c1">: Beats all below</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8">SCO</span><span class="c1">: Beats all below</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8">Willow</span><span class="c1">: Beats all below but stalemates Bronze and Oscar</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8">Bronze</span><span class="c1">: Beats all below</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8">Oscar</span><span class="c1">: Beats all below</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8">Arcator</span><span class="c1">: Beats all below</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8">Pulvis Terrae</span><span class="c1">: Beats all below but stalemates Susie and Remy</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8">Susie</span><span class="c1">:Beats all below</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8">Remy</span><span class="c1">: Beats all below</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8">Mia</span><span class="c1">: Beats all below</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8">Eliza</span><span class="c1">: Beats all below</span></p><h1 class="c13" id="h.1pns0ix3iguo"><span class="c17 c8">Potential Plot Holes?</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c16 c8">1. If Ethan has NEG DIFF and INSTA WIN, why doesn&#39;t he use that to every villain?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The Timeless Multiversal Moral Code (TMMC) says that it is the most evil act to use omnipotence, with a few exceptions:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">If it&#39;s very very minor, e.g., cleaning up a spill</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">If an infinite sum of pain/danger/evil is at stake, e.g., when Bronze had to play God to defeat Eliza</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">If reality warps so that you can play God without playing God</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">And it&#39;s really frowned upon to try and bypass it by using omnipotence to use omnipotence without using omnipotence somehow, even though you theoretically could. You just don&#39;t do it. It&#39;s also very insignificant to people with omnipotence, and you can be hated for trying to bypass it and something.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">In summary, it&#39;s just kinda evil to use omnipotence just to get your way.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Ethan limits himself as a superhero, Fractus.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Ethan as a normal non superhero, doesn&#39;t hold back only when powerscaled. It&#39;s also mentioned how he doesn&#39;t even play God, and he just has a natural power to NEG DIFF, and remember that 99% of the main story is Ethan as Fractus, and Fractus purposefully limits himself FOR the story. If 99% of the story was just Ethan as a normal human guy, then he&#39;d also limit himself.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">And about the Bob vs Ethan, they&#39;ve never actually fought. It just goes like this</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Ethan &gt; Bob &gt; Alex &gt; Haziel &gt; Harrold &gt; God Unit &gt; Everyone Else.</span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c16 c8">2. Did Bronze go against Eliza when giving everyone free will?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">No. Eliza never even requested that Bronze do not give free will. It&#39;s just something she forgot to mention.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Eliza: Wait, you mean Willow isn&#39;t even going to help us get the Pulvis Force back?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Bronze: I mean, I would if I could, but you know, the TMMC says we can&#39;t use our omnipotence to do it ourselves, and we can&#39;t make a being without free will.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Eliza: Oh.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Bronze: We&#39;re still incredibly powerful though. It&#39;s just destiny.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Eliza: Yeah you&#39;re right.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">-basically the entire dialogue.</span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">3. Eliza powerful or not?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Ok so Eliza&#39;s nigh omnipotence is just like, able to summon anything, like small objects, and able to maybe move some thing, but it doesn&#39;t completely always work.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">IF Eliza doesn&#39;t really imagine the object with enough vivid detail, it won&#39;t summon, and if she moves a person towards her, but they grab on to a tree, it&#39;s gonna be an obstacle.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">And also, her moving downwards is supposed to be vague. If she like, moves downwards a certain way, she may or may not lose it. It&#39;s like a 1 in 30 chance it works. That&#39;s genuinely her weakness.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">By 1 in 30 chance, I mean that 1 in 30 downwards movements will make her powers fail.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c13" id="h.6pkanlq144x9"><span class="c17 c8">Important Clarification(s)</span></h1><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Willow decided NOT to gain back the Pulvis Force because she had free will. Eliza intended for her to be forced to steal it back from Ethan and give it to the God Unit, which Bronze didn&rsquo;t fully agree with, but did it anyways, and Eliza didn&rsquo;t mention to create her without free will. So, they never got it back, and Ethan and Willow remained the co-founders of it.<br></span></p><h1 class="c13" id="h.pzu6b38oi31p"><span class="c17 c8">Bob: Second Strongest</span></h1><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Alright so we see that Bob is stronger than Alex, but Alex is indestructible to every being besides Ethan Duster. How does Bob beat Alex? Well Bob has a reality warping nature of the Pulvis Force, similar to Ethan, that allows him to do something, without doing, something. So he can destroy the soul of Alex, without destroying the soul, of Alex. Does it make sense? Absolutely not. Does it work? Yes. Does it count as Bob being able to destroy Alex? No, because &ldquo;being able&rdquo; means it is possible for Bob to defeat Alex, and it is impossible for Bob to beat Alex, but Bob can do anything impossible (besides beating Ethan Duster), but still keep it possible. So CAN Bob beat Alex? No. DOES Bob beat Alex? Absolutely.<br><br>Bob also has like a 5 person fanbase of him.<br><br>They&rsquo;re similar stickmen just like Bob, and each of them have their own color. One is red, one is orange, one is yellow, one is green, and one is purple. They don&rsquo;t have actual names, and they&rsquo;re just called their assigned colors. Red guy is called red, purple guy is called purple, and yeah.<br><br>They are basically disciples of Bob, and they follow him.<br><br>They all have the same roles. They are body guards, cheerleaders, friends, servants, and just do everything for him. <br><br>But Bob isn&rsquo;t like the bossy king that goes, &ldquo;GET ME A GLASS OF JUICE, RED MAN&rdquo;.<br><br>He just asks nicely like, &ldquo;hey red could you get us some juice?&rdquo;<br><br>I could describe them as a wolf pack. <br></span></p><h1 class="c13" id="h.3v0z93br3ks6"><span class="c3"><br></span><span class="c17 c8">NEW UPDATES!!!</span></h1><ul class="c14 lst-kix_mq8jcxyifpjm-0 start"><li class="c5 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Fractus implanted infinitely weighted microchips into his ankles and legs, and he has infinitely weighted wristbands that he wears.

Yes he feels the pain, yes it hurts as much as it&rsquo;d hurt any human, no there&rsquo;s no magic, he really just pushes through. It also gives him like insane moodswings 5 times every hour that takes up to like 5 minutes. Like I&rsquo;m talking mental health issues.

Then like, Japan grows bigger than America, and that&rsquo;s Bob&rsquo;s mansion that he calls, the Mansion of Bob, and America is slightly smaller, and Ethan just names it america.

got the OG that started it all, Sophia&rsquo;s Street. Without making a tiny lil scribble of a guy in a hoodie and naming him Felix, today would not be as it is.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Even though I animated this first, this is the second idea i had.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Shaders and Shiners. A lil psychological warfare game where they all have to escape, but never get to.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Then we got Revelation. 3rd but classic. A show bout the heavenly angels.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Then we got Sophia&rsquo;s Street REVAMP. Where Ethan has a REAL human form, and Willow is introduced. Pentajon got a real human form, Synthia is now Eliza and has a real neck, and everything is JUUUSTT swell.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Of course for number 5 we got Swipe System 1.0. Classic, again. It&rsquo;s the doctor version where Ethan is a doctor, and the doc, is, in.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Then numba 6 we got Swipe System Game. aka, 2.0. This one is probably a least favorite. Seems just like all typical. Deadly survival games in life or death scenarios with a crazy and insane host who kidnaps them, and forces each other into teams.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">7, we got TODAY&rsquo;S modern Swipe System where it&rsquo;s just yk, random wars between friends and friends between enemies, betrayal, and just about anything.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">8. We got SSA,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">9. PACKED UP! YES THAT&rsquo;S RIGHT I HAVE A NEW SHOW CALLED PACKED UP!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s just Harrold being Harrold and just kinda destroying a government organization but that&rsquo;s for another day.*</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c13" id="h.85s81fw8hep3"><span class="c17 c8">*ANOTHER DAY!</span></h1><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Yeah so here&rsquo;s Packed Up! In a nutshell.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">So like there&rsquo;s this government organization called the DIV which stands for development of individual organizations, and it just basically has a multiple AI&rsquo;s discussing what to write next on the script of reality and life, which controls everything and anything we do. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">anyways.</span></p><div><p class="c9 c18"><span class="c16 c23"></span></p></div></body></html>
